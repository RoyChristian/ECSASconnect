- add "survey type" (or some such) arg to ecsas.extract to specify ship (default) or aerial.
- add facility to insert aerial data
- create a generic way of dealing with WHERE subclauses that require multiple matches (like species). Will need
	this often.
- deal with cruises where there were two observers (one on each side)
- combine the multiple queries for watch, sighting, etc into one
- add facility to select Program (ECSAS, PIROP, etc)
- add facility to specify minimum speed
- add ability to specify moving surveys (not stationary)
- add ability to specify species groups
- add cruise, watch and species criteria from general query form
- do table joins in SQL instead of using jion in R since SQL is likely much more efficient.
- add "classType" argument ie. Bird, Mammal, etc
- figure out if database is open for exclusive use, 
- come up with a more generic method for specifying filtering options instead of adding a separate param everytime to
ECSAS.extract. Maybe a list of name=value pairs or some such??
- make variable name structure consistent (either camelCase or dotted.separation)
- apply Hadley Wickhams style guide (http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) 
- add unit tests
- test return from sqlQuery for errors
- add an option to select whether watches with zero obs are returned or not.
- add option to remove zero or null length transects
- add calculation for estimated windspeed if it is null and windforce is given
