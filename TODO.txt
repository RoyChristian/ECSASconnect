- add option to convert all fields with lookup tables to their proper values. Make this optional in order to protect legacy code that
  depends on old behaviour?? Thinking of any code that was used to extract data for the Urgence App. 
- change name of platform.activity variable to platform.type. Confusing with PlatformActivity
- add error checking for data returned from queries
- add "survey type" (or some such) arg to ecsas.extract to specify ship (default) or aerial.
- add facility to insert aerial data
- create a generic way of dealing with WHERE subclauses that require multiple matches (like species). Will need
	this often.
- deal with cruises where there were two observers (one on each side)
- combine the multiple queries for watch, sighting, etc into one
- add facility to select Program (ECSAS, PIROP, etc)
- add facility to specify minimum speed
- add ability to specify moving surveys (not stationary)
- add ability to specify species groups
- add cruise, watch and species criteria from general query form
- do table joins in SQL instead of using jion in R since SQL is likely much more efficient.
- add "classType" argument ie. Bird, Mammal, etc
- figure out if database is open for exclusive use, 
- come up with a more generic method for specifying filtering options instead of adding a separate param everytime to
ECSAS.extract. Maybe a list of name=value pairs or some such?? Or just don't bother and do filtering in calling program.
- make variable name structure consistent (either camelCase or dotted.separation)
- apply Hadley Wickhams style guide (http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) 
- add unit tests
- test return from sqlQuery for errors
- add an option to select whether watches with zero obs are returned or not.
- add option to remove zero or null length transects
- add calculation for estimated windspeed if it is null and windforce is given
