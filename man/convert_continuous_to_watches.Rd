\title{Convert a series of continuous aerial observations}
\usage{
convert_continuous_to_watches(cont, watchlen = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{cont}{Input data frame of continuous observations}

\item{watchlen}{The links in minutes of each watch to be created (default 1
minute).}
}
\value{
Returns a list with elements \code{transects, watches}, and
 \code{observations} suitable for insertion into the ECSAS database using
 \code{ECSAS.??????()}.
}
\description{
This function takes a data frame of continuous observations and
 converts them into the transect/watch/observation structure required by
 ECSAS. Each row of the \code{cont} data frame contains either an
 observation, a transect start/end record, or a weather update record. Each
 transect is cut into watches (of \code{watchlen} minutes each) beginning
 from the time of the transect start record. Thus the final watch in each
 transect may not be a full \code{watchlen} minutes long.
}
\details{
I envision this being called after creating a \code{tblAerialSurvey}
 record and before transects, watches and observations are added to the
 appropriate tables. Or, perhaps instead, it should do the insertion
 on-the-fly as it goes. I wonder what's easierâ€¦
