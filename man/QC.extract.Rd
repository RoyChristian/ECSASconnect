\title{Extract the information for the Quebec ECSAS database}
\usage{
QC.extract(
  sp = "ATPU",
  years = c(2006, 2013),
  lat = c(30, 70),
  long = c(-70, -30),
  Obs.keep = NA,
  Obs.exclude = NA,
  intransect = T,
  ecsas.drive = "C:/Users/christian/Dropbox/ECSAS",
  ecsas.file = "Oiseaux marins 2006-2014.accdb"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sp}{Alpha code for the specie desired in the extraction. If more than one species all the desired species must be saved into a vector ex: c("COMU,"TBMU", "UNMU")}

\item{years}{Years desired for the extraction}

\item{lat}{Pairs of coordinate giving the southern and northern limits of the range desired.}

\item{long}{Pairs of coordinate giving the western and eastern limits of the range desired. Note that longitude values must be negative.}

\item{Obs.exclude}{Name of the observer to exlude for the extraction.The name of the observer must be followed by it's first name (eg: "Bolduc_Francois").}

\item{intransect}{Should we keep only the birds counted on the transect or not.}

\item{ecsas.drive}{Where is located the Quebec ECSAS Access database}

\item{ecsas.file}{What is the name of the Quebec ECSAS Access database}

\item{obs.keep}{Name of the observer to keep for the extraction. The name of the observer must be followed by it's first name (eg: "Bolduc_Francois").}
